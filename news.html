                    <h3>Artistic Media</h3>
					<p> Art is anything we can create with our own hands and minds. An old tire and voila it is a sculpture. Canvas, you've got a beautiful painting, fabric a fabulous quilt, rocks become jewerly, metal becomes a statue. You name it, it will be used. <br> Not only do we have art that can be seen, we also have art that can be heard. Music, yes, music is art. It moves you, it gets into your soul, music can make you happy or sad, music can take you places.<br> An artist  pours out his/her soul and shares with the world. They take a chance of being criticized or loved for their creation. They give to us, we need to give back to them. I do understand money is tight these days, but how hard is it to tell someone what they created brought you happiness or took you somewhere. You may ask "What if I don't like it?" you have two options as I see it, encourage the person to continue or don't say anything at all. Okay three, applaud them for their courage. At times life is hard, they don't need to be hit up side the head with a figutive two by four. It is not an easy thing to step out on the stage and give of yourself. Let's encouarge one another.</p>
